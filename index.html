          “Best cards for X” and “top 10” lists are common in card content. This page explains how list-style roundups can be built in a neutral, documentation-first way — focusing on structure, criteria and disclosures rather than personal recommendations.

    <!-- Overview -->
    <section id="overview" class="section">
      <h2>What Is a Credit-Card List?</h2>
      <p>A credit-card list is a structured page that groups multiple products into a single view. Common examples include lists of travel cards, cashback cards, student cards or cards for a specific spending pattern.</p>
      <p>In a documentation-driven approach, a list does not declare a universal “best” card. Instead, it organizes products by documented features: pricing, rewards, protections, technology and issuer policies.</p>
    </section>

    <!-- Structure / mechanics -->
    <section id="mechanics" class="section">
      <h2>How List-Style Pages Are Built</h2>
      <p>Most list pages follow a repeatable structure, even if it is not described explicitly. A neutral list typically includes:</p>
      <ul class="list">
        <li><strong>Scope definition</strong> – which cards are considered and why they belong in the list.</li>
        <li><strong>Selection criteria</strong> – which features or metrics are used to choose and group products.</li>
        <li><strong>Ordering logic</strong> – whether cards are ordered alphabetically, by category, by feature or by a scoring model.</li>
        <li><strong>Per-card summaries</strong> – brief descriptions based on documentation, not predictions or guarantees.</li>
        <li><strong>Disclosures</strong> – clear information about affiliate links, sponsorships and data sources.</li>
      </ul>
      <p>By separating structure from opinion, lists can be read as navigational tools into the wider comparison ecosystem.</p>
    </section>

    <section class="section">
      <h2>Types of Lists &amp; Roundups</h2>
      <p>List-style content can be organized in different ways depending on topic and intent:</p>
      <ul class="list">
        <li><strong>Category lists</strong> – for example travel, cashback, business, student or secured cards.</li>
        <li><strong>Use-case lists</strong> – such as frequent-flyer cards, everyday-spend cards or FX-focused cards.</li>
        <li><strong>Feature lists</strong> – cards with specific protections, technologies or loyalty integrations.</li>
        <li><strong>Educational lists</strong> – documenting how different product types fit into an ecosystem.</li>
      </ul>
      <p>All of these can be built from the same underlying documentation, but with different angles and headings.</p>
    </section>

    <section class="section">
      <h2>Disclosures, Bias and Update Cycles</h2>
      <p>List pages can be affected by commercial relationships and changing product terms. Neutral documentation acknowledges that:</p>
      <ul class="list">
        <li>Affiliate links or sponsorships may influence which products are shown, and this should be disclosed clearly.</li>
        <li>Terms, rewards structures and protections change over time, so lists represent a snapshot as of a given date.</li>
        <li>No list can represent every product in a market, and absence from a list does not imply judgment.</li>
      </ul>
      <p>Readers benefit when update dates, data sources and commercial relationships are easy to see and understand.</p>
